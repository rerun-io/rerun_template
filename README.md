# Rerun template repository
Template for our private and public repos, containing CI, CoC, etc

When creating a new Rerun repository, use this as a template, then modify it as it makes sense.

This template should be the default for any repository of any kind, including:
* Rust projects
* C++ projects
* Python projects
* Other stuff

This template includes
* License files
* Code of Conduct
* Helpers for checking and linting Rust code
  - `cargo-cranky`
  - `cargo-deny`
  - `rust-toolchain`
* CI for:
  - Spell checking
  - Link checking
  - Rust checks


## How to use
Start by clicking "Use this template" at https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun_template/ or follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Then search for `TODO` and fill in all those places (including changing the whole contents of this `README.md`, obviously).
